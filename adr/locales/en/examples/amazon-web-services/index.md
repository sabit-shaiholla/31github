# Architecture Decision Record for Amazon Web Services

Title: Adopting Amazon Web Services for Cloud Infrastructure

## Decision

After a thorough evaluation of various cloud infrastructure platforms, it has been decided that Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be adopted by our organization for our cloud infrastructure needs.

## Background

Our organization is growing rapidly and we need a reliable and scalable cloud infrastructure to meet the demands of our business. After considering a number of cloud infrastructure providers, it was concluded that AWS offers the most suitable range of services to meet our current and future requirements.

## Considerations

There are numerous cloud infrastructure providers in the market that have proven to be reliable and efficient. However, AWS not only offers a comprehensive set of services to cater to our needs, but it also has an extensive customer base and a track record of successful deployments. AWS also provides a broad range of support and training resources to ensure that our team can work effectively with the platform.

Furthermore, AWS has an extensive global presence with data centers located in various regions around the world. This ensures that our data is secure and our applications and services will be highly available. AWS also has a robust security framework that is critical for our business.

Lastly, AWS provides a pay-as-you-go model which offers us the flexibility to scale our infrastructure based on demand. This means that we will only be charged for what we use, which allows us to optimize our costs and invest in other areas of the business.

## Decision

Based on the evaluations performed and the advantages offered by AWS, it has been decided that AWS will be adopted for our cloud infrastructure needs.

## Consequences

The adoption of AWS may require training for our teams to ensure that they are familiar with the platform and can effectively utilize it. There may also be some initial costs to move our current infrastructure to the AWS platform.

## Ownership

The responsibility for ensuring the effective utilization of AWS and the management of associated risks will fall within the remit of the cloud infrastructure team. Any issues that arise must be addressed by this team.

## Review

The decision to adopt AWS will be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that it continues to meet our needs and that the benefits of the platform are being fully realized.
