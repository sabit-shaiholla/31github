# Architecture Decision Record: Docker Swarm Container Orchestration

Decision Number: 001

Decision Maker: [Your name or position]

Date: [Date of decision]

## Context

We are considering different container orchestration tools to manage our microservices-based architecture. We have evaluated different solutions like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesosphere DC/OS. However, we have decided to focus on Docker Swarm due to its simplicity, integration with Docker, and built-in load balancing.

## Decision

We have decided to use Docker Swarm as our container orchestration tool. Docker Swarm provides a simple and intuitive way to manage containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. It also allows us to leverage our existing Docker-based workflows and infrastructure. With Docker Swarm, we can easily deploy, scale, and manage our applications, all while taking advantage of built-in load balancing.

## Benefits

- **Simplicity:**  Docker Swarm follows the same principles as Docker, so there's no need to learn a new technology. The learning curve is relatively shallow for developers familiar with Docker.

- **Integration:**  Docker Swarm integrates seamlessly with Docker tools, like Docker Compose, making it easier to manage all our containers and services from one place.

- **Load balancing:**  Docker Swarm provides built-in load balancing, ensuring that our applications are always available and evenly distributed across the cluster.

- **Scalability:**  Docker Swarm makes it easy to scale our applications horizontally by adding or removing nodes from the cluster.

- **High availability:**  Docker Swarm automatically distributes our services across nodes, providing high availability in case of node failure.

## Risks

- **Limited functionality:**  Docker Swarm may lack some of the advanced features found in Kubernetes or Mesosphere DC/OS, like automatic scaling or self-healing.

- **Docker-centric:**  Docker Swarm is tightly coupled with Docker, which may limit our flexibility if we ever need to move away from Docker-based solutions.

- **Immaturity:**  Docker Swarm is still a relatively new technology, and there may be some stability issues or gaps in documentation.

## Alternatives

- **Kubernetes:**  Kubernetes is the most widely-used container orchestration platform and provides advanced features and a more mature ecosystem. However, it has a steeper learning curve and may be overkill for our needs.

- **Mesosphere DC/OS:**  Mesosphere DC/OS is a powerful tool that provides advanced features like multi-cloud support and native big data and AI platform capabilities. However, it requires significant expertise to implement and may be too complex for our requirements.

## Conclusion

After careful consideration, we have decided to use Docker Swarm as our container orchestration tool. Docker Swarm provides the simplicity, integration, and built-in load balancing we need to manage our containerized applications. Although it may lack some advanced features, we believe Docker Swarm's benefits outweigh its risks for our current requirements.
