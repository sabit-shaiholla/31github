# Architecture Decision Record: Kubernetes container orchestration

## Problem Statement 

We need to select a container orchestration platform for our growing cloud-native application portfolio. Our current legacy platform deployment is too slow, and not agile enough to keep up with our growing needs. We’re looking for a system that will allow us to scale our services in the most efficient way possible without compromising on agility or ease of use.

## Considered Alternatives

1. Docker Swarm

2. Kubernetes

3. Apache Mesos

## Decision Made

After conducting a thorough analysis of each container orchestration platform, we have decided to adopt Kubernetes as the best option for our enterprise needs. Our reasons for choosing Kubernetes are as follows:

1. **Scalability:**  Kubernetes’s unique design is perfect for scaling applications, and as our requirements for scalability evolve over time, Kubernetes has the built-in ability to meet these changes without any issues.

2. **Decentralized Architecture:**  Kubernetes’ master-worker topology ensures a decentralized architecture which ensures that there is no single point of failure.

3. **Community Support:**  Kubernetes has the largest and most active open-source community, which means it has a large number of contributors, developers, and vendors making it easier for us to get help and find resources.

4. **Ecosystem Support:**  Kubernetes has a growing ecosystem with a variety of third-party tools, integrations with container registries, CI/CD pipelines, data storage, and more.

Therefore, we have decided to adopt Kubernetes as our container orchestration platform for the present and the immediate future.
