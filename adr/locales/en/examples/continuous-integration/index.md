# Decision Record for continuous integration

Title: Decision to Implement Continuous Integration

## Context

The company has been experiencing challenges with the development process as a result of manual testing, build processes, and deployments. This has led to frequent delays, errors and inconsistencies in the quality and delivery of the software.

## Decision

To implement continuous integration as a solution to the challenges experienced in the development process.

## Rationale

Continuous integration will automatically build, test and deploy code changes to the delivery environment in a timely and efficient manner. It will enable integration of new features into the codebase without interfering with the stability of the software. Continuous integration will enhance the quality and delivery of the software, reduce the time taken to resolve errors and improve stakeholder satisfaction.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Improved quality and delivery of software 

- Time and cost savings through automation 

- Enhanced collaboration and integration within the development team 

Negative:

- Initial costs associated with implementing the technology 

- Upfront investment in people, tools and processes required to implement continuous integration 

- Potential risk of technical difficulties during the implementation.

## Conclusion

The benefits of implementing continuous integration outweigh the costs of investment and the potential risks. Therefore, the decision to implement continuous integration has been approved.
