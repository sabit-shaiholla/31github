# Decision record for 4-day work-week

Title: Implementation of 4-Day Work-week

## Context and Problem Statement

Our organization has been considering a switch to a 4-day workweek. The current work schedule of 5 days per week, 8 hours per day, has resulted in low productivity, employee burnout, and high turnover rates. The proposed change aims to increase employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention, and ultimately improve organizational performance.

## Decision

We have decided to implement a 4-day workweek starting from the next quarter for all employees across the organization.

## Rationale

The decision was based on the following factors:

1. Employee feedback: A survey conducted among the employees highlighted the desire for a more flexible work schedule and a better work-life balance. The majority of the respondents expressed interest in a 4-day workweek.

2. Research findings: Studies on companies that have implemented a 4-day workweek have shown increased employee productivity, reduced absenteeism, and improved work-life balance.

3. Competitive advantage: Offering a 4-day workweek can be an attractive benefit to potential employees and can help retain existing talent.

4. Organizational goals: The switch to a 4-day workweek aligns with our organizational goals to create a healthier and more productive work environment.

## Implementation Plan

The following steps will be taken to implement the 4-day workweek:

1. Communication: The decision will be communicated to all employees via a company-wide email and a meeting with team leaders.

2. Schedule: The new schedule will be Monday to Thursday for full-time employees, with the option of flexible schedules for part-time employees. Work hours will be extended to 10 hours per day.

3. Policy updates: Human resources policies, such as leave policies and benefits, will be updated to align with the new schedule.

4. Training: Managers will be trained on how to manage teams under the new schedule and how to properly track employee performance and productivity.

5. Evaluation: The new work schedule will be evaluated after six months to determine its impact on employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention.

## Anticipated outcomes

The implementation of a 4-day workweek is expected to result in the following outcomes:

1. Increased employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention.

2. Improved work-life balance for employees.

3. Increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.

4. More attractive employee benefit package and a competitive advantage in the hiring market. 

## Conclusion

We believe that the implementation of a 4-day workweek will benefit our organization and our employees. We look forward to seeing the positive impact of this decision on our employees and our overall organizational performance.
