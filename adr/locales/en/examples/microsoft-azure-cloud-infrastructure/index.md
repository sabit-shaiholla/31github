Decision Maker: Chief Information Officer

Date: 2021-10-15

Status: Approved

## Background

The organization is planning to migrate from traditional on-premises infrastructure to cloud infrastructure. In order to achieve this, the organization has evaluated multiple cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud. Each provider has its own set of features, benefits, and pricing structure. After a detailed analysis, it was concluded that Microsoft Azure is the most suitable option for our organization.

## Decision

Adopt Microsoft Azure as the cloud infrastructure for our organization.

## Rationale

The following are the reasons for adopting Microsoft Azure:

1. Comprehensive Services: Azure provides a complete range of cloud services from infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). This enables us to leverage Azure services to solve the organization's requirements, such as storage, compute, networking, and analytics.

2. Scalability and Flexibility: With Azure, we can easily scale up or down resources based on our business requirements. Azure also offers flexibility in choosing the operating system, programming language, and frameworks.

3. Security and Compliance: Azure offers a high level of security and compliance, as it is compliant with several industry standards such as ISO, SOC, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Azure also provides advanced security features such as network security groups, firewalls, and DDoS protection.

4. Hybrid Cloud: Azure provides a seamless hybrid cloud experience, enabling organizations to connect their on-premises infrastructure with Azure. This makes it easy for us to migrate workloads to the cloud and provides us with the flexibility to choose where to store data.

5. Cost-effective: Azure offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means we only pay for the resources used. This helps us save costs when compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Adopting Microsoft Azure as the cloud infrastructure for our organization aligns with our business requirements and offers several benefits such as scalability, flexibility, security, and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt Azure as our cloud infrastructure.
