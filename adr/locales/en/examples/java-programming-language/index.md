# Architecture Decision Record: Java programming language

Title: Choosing Java Programming Language for the Project

Decision: After evaluating multiple programming languages, we have decided to use Java for our project.

### Background

We intended to build a web-based application that could run on multiple operating systems. Our project required a language that could provide strong security features, handle concurrency, support large code bases, and be versatile enough to meet our future growth requirements. We evaluated several languages, considering their strengths and limitations, before deciding on Java.

### Considerations

1. **Security:**  Java provides excellent security features through its well-defined security policies and access control. It also incorporates features like bytecode verification, which helps prevent malicious software from running on a system.

2. **Concurrency:**  Java has built-in support for multithreading, which allows applications to perform several tasks simultaneously. This feature makes Java an excellent choice for developing large, complex applications with multiple features and functionalities.

3. **Large codebases:**  Java supports object-oriented programming, which makes it a suitable choice for developing large codebases. Its modular nature and use of encapsulation and abstraction patterns further add to the software development process's ease.

4. **Versatility:**  Java is versatile and provides the ability to use a wide range of libraries and frameworks, making it an excellent choice for both web-based and enterprise-level applications.

### Decision Outcome

We have decided to use the Java programming language for our project, considering its security features, concurrency support, ability to handle large codebases, and versatility. This decision aligns with our project requirements, and we believe that choosing Java will ensure its success. 

### Consequences

1. We will need developers who have experience with Java and can use it proficiently.

2. Any code written in the language must be compatible with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. Incorporating new features, functionalities, or frameworks may present some challenges.

4. Large, complex projects in Java may require more time and resources to develop.
