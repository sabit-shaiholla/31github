# Architecture Decision Record: Python programming language

## Context

We need to decide on whether to use Python as a programming language for our project. Our project involves data analysis, machine learning, and web development.

## Decision

We have decided to use Python as our primary programming language for our project.

## Rationale

Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used in the areas of data analysis, machine learning, and web 
development. It is an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled, and it has an easy-to-read and understand syntax. Other important factors for our decision include the following:

1. **Availability of libraries:** Python has a huge collection of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, which makes it easier for developers to implement machine learning algorithms and data analysis.

2. **Community support:** Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support and guidance on various forums and websites. This makes it easier for beginners to find help and learn the language.

3. **Scalability:** Python is scalable, which means that it can handle large datasets and complex applications. It can also be used for rapid prototyping or building small applications with minimal effort, making it easier for us to start our project and iterate quickly.

4. **Flexibility:** Python can be used for various types of projects, including web development, scientific computing, machine learning, etc. It is also compatible with other programming languages, such as Java and C++, which makes it easier to integrate with other systems.

## Consequences

There are some potential consequences to using Python as our programming language, such as:

1. **Performance:** Python can be slower than compiled languages like C++ when it comes to executing certain algorithms, but this can be mitigated by using optimized libraries or writing critical code in C++ and interfacing with it using Python.

2. **Learning curve:** While Python has an easy-to-learn syntax, it can be challenging to learn the best practices for writing efficient and scalable code. This can be overcome by following conventions, using frameworks and libraries, and seeking guidance from experienced developers.

3. **Version compatibility:** Different versions of Python can have different syntax and capabilities, which can make it difficult to maintain and update projects. It is important to choose a version of Python that is widely supported and compatible with our project requirements.

## Conclusion

After considering the pros and cons of using Python as our programming language, we have decided that it is the best choice for our project. We believe that it will provide us with the most flexibility, availability of libraries, and community support, while also being scalable and adaptable to our changing needs.
