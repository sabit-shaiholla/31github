# Architecture Decision Record: Programming Code Editors

## Context

Programming code editors are an essential tool for developers to write and edit code. There are numerous code editors available, each with its own set of features, advantages, and disadvantages. The purpose of this ADR is to document the architectural decisions made for programming code editors.

## Priorities

The architecture for programming code editors should prioritize the following:

* **Modularity**: The code editor should be designed in a modular way, allowing developers to customize and extend it as needed. This allows for a flexible architecture that can adapt to the needs of different developers and teams.

* **Performance**: The code editor should be performant and responsive, allowing developers to work efficiently without being slowed down by the tool they are using.

* **User Interface**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, allowing developers to focus on their code rather than struggling with the editor.

* **Extensibility**: The code editor should be designed to allow for easy extension with third-party plugins and integrations.

* **Compatibility**: The code editor should be compatible with a wide range of programming languages and technologies, making it a useful tool for a broad range of developers.

## Decision

Based on these priorities, the architecture for programming code editors should be designed with the following components:

* **Core**: This component provides the basic functionality of the code editor, such as syntax highlighting, text editing, and file management.

* **UI**: This component provides the user interface for the code editor, including menus, toolbars, and keyboard shortcuts.

* **Plugins**: This component allows developers to extend the functionality of the code editor by installing third-party plugins. Plugins can provide additional features, such as code completion, linting, or debugging.

* **Integrations**: This component allows the code editor to integrate with other tools and technologies, such as version control systems, build systems, or debugging tools.

## Rationale

The modularity of the code editor allows developers to customize and extend it as needed. This is important because different developers and teams have different needs and workflows, and a flexible architecture can accommodate these differences.

* **Performance**: crucial because developers need to be able to work efficiently without being slowed down by their tools. A performant code editor is essential for productivity and can help developers maintain their focus and concentration.

* **UI**: important because it allows developers to focus on their code rather than struggling with the editor. This can lead to better productivity and less frustration for developers.

* **Extensibility**: powerful because it allows the code editor to be adapted to different needs and workflows. Third-party plugins and integrations can provide additional features and capabilities that are not included in the core editor.

* **Compatibility**: valuable because it allows the code editor to be used with a wide range of programming languages and technologies. This makes the editor a more useful tool for a broad range of developers.

The core, plugins, integrations, and UI components provide a clear separation of concerns and allow for a modular architecture that can be easily extended and customized. This architecture is flexible, performant, and compatible with a wide range of programming languages and technologies, making it a useful tool for developers.
