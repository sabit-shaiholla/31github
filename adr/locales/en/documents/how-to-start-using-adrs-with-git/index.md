# How to start using ADRs with git

If you like using git version control, then here is how we like to start using ADRs with git for a typical software project with source code.

Create a directory for ADR files:

```sh
$ mkdir adr
```

For each ADR, create a text file, such as `database.txt`:

```sh
$ vi database.txt
```

Write anything you want in the ADR. See the templates in this repository for ideas.

Commit the ADR to your git repo.
